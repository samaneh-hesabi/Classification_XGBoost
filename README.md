<div style="font-size:2.5em; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; margin-top:20px;">Wine Classification with XGBoost</div>

## 1. Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use XGBoost (a powerful machine learning algorithm) to classify wine samples into different categories based on their chemical properties.

## 2. What the Code Does

The Python script `scr/ddd.py` performs the following steps:

1. **Loads the Wine dataset** - Uses the cleaned and scaled wine dataset
2. **Splits the data** - Divides the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
3. **Creates and trains an XGBoost model** - Builds a classifier that can identify wine types
4. **Makes predictions** - Tests the model on new data it hasn't seen before
5. **Evaluates performance** - Calculates how accurate the model is
6. **Creates visualizations** - Generates helpful charts to understand the results

## 3. Files in this Project

- `scr/ddd.py` - The main Python script with the classification code
- `scr/data_preparation.py` - Script for cleaning and preparing the wine dataset
- `data/` - Directory containing the cleaned and scaled datasets
- `red_wine_confusion_matrix.png` - Image showing how well the model classifies each wine type
- `red_wine_feature_importance.png` - Image showing which chemical properties are most important

## 4. How to Run the Code

### 4.1 Using pip

Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

First, prepare the data:

```bash
python scr/data_preparation.py
```

Then run the classification:

```bash
python scr/ddd.py
```

### 4.2 Using conda

You can also set up the environment using conda:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate wine_classification
```

Then run the scripts as described above:

```bash
python scr/data_preparation.py
python scr/ddd.py
```

## 5. Understanding the Output

When you run the code, you'll see:

1. **Accuracy score** - How often the model predicts correctly (higher is better)
2. **Classification report** - Detailed metrics for each wine class
3. **Confusion matrix** - Shows correct vs. incorrect predictions
4. **Feature importance** - Which chemical properties matter most for classification

## 6. Key Machine Learning Concepts

- **Features** - The chemical measurements used to make predictions
- **Target** - The wine class we're trying to predict (0, 1, 2, 3)
- **Training/Testing** - We use some data to learn patterns and other data to test
- **XGBoost** - A powerful algorithm that uses decision trees to make predictions
- **Confusion Matrix** - Shows where the model gets confused between classes
- **Feature Importance** - Helps us understand which measurements matter most

## 8. Results and Interpretation

The model's performance can be evaluated using:

1. **Confusion Matrix** - The heatmap shows which wine quality classes are correctly predicted and where misclassifications occur. Darker blue squares along the diagonal indicate better performance.

2. **Feature Importance** - The bar chart shows which chemical properties have the most influence on wine quality prediction. Features with higher importance scores have a greater impact on the model's decisions.

3. **Classification Report** - This provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each wine quality class, helping to identify if the model performs better for certain quality levels.

## 9. Future Improvements

To enhance this project, consider:

1. **Model Persistence** - Add code to save the trained model to a file for later use
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning** - Experiment with different XGBoost parameters to improve accuracy
3. **Cross-Validation** - Implement k-fold cross-validation for more robust evaluation
4. **Feature Selection** - Try different combinations of features to optimize model performance
5. **Web Interface** - Create a simple web app to make predictions on new wine samples

## 10. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for wine quality classification using XGBoost. By following the steps in this README, you can understand how to prepare data, train a model, evaluate its performance, and interpret the results. The code is structured to be educational and can serve as a template for other classification tasks.
